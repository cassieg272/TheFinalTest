By using git status I can see the status of what has happened within my git project.
I can see that I am on the branch Master and I have not made any commits yet.
I can see that I have changes that have been added but still need to be committed (ex. new files).
I can also see that I have files that have been modified but have not yet been staged for commit (ex. modified: Command.txt)
